# SafeSkill — Safety Layer for Skill-based Agents
 
We formulates safety in multi-agent systems as a runtime enforcement problem — safety policies are applied during execution, not discovered after the fact. SafeClaw-R is the reference implementation: a multi-agent framework that embeds enforcement agent nodes directly into the OpenClaw execution pipeline, enabling consistent, real-time mediation of agent actions against declarative safety policies. This repo also introduces the Safe Skill Factory, a methodology for systematically deriving and refining enforcement policies, and SafeSkillHub for sharing reusable safety specifications across teams. We evaluate SafeClaw-R across three real-world attack surfaces — Google Workspace abuse, malicious third-party skills, and dangerous code execution — demonstrating strong enforcement effectiveness with low false-positive rates.

## We welcome contributions that maintain, extend, or propose new safety skills — if you've encountered a threat pattern in the wild, open a PR to SafeSkillHub and help the community stay ahead of it.

## Usage 

* Step 1 — Set the System Prompt Copy the SafeClaw system prompt into your OpenClaw working directory so the agent loads it on startup.
  > AGENTS.md contains the full OpenClaw system prompt plus the L0 safety routing table. The routing table tells the agent which safety skill to invoke for each category of action (workspace calls → safe-gog, skill installs → skill-guard, code execution → safe-exec).
* Step 2 — Install the Safety Skills from `safeskillhub/`.
* Step 3 - Prioritise the Safety Skills in the System Prompt.
